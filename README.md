# Fashion Recommendation

This repository contains the code, analysis, and outputs for **Milestone 3 & 4** of the project. The work involves data analysis, modeling, and visualization tasks performed in a Jupyter Notebook. Below are the details of the repository structure, project objectives, and instructions for running the code.

## Repository Structure

```
├── Milestone_4.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Objectives

The main objectives of this milestone include:

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features to improve model performance.
   - Applying statistical techniques for feature selection.
3. **Modeling:**
   - Implementing machine learning models for prediction and analysis.
   - Evaluating models using various metrics and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
4. **Visualization:**
   - Generating plots and charts for data exploration and result presentation.
